msa_clustalo.py performs a multiple sequence alignment on a set of input
sequences provided in a fasta file

This script checks if clustalo is instaled, checks the script was run properly,
checks the sequences are properly formated, and then proceeds to run the MSA.

Usage:
python msa_clustalo.py file.fasta outpath err label

The parameters are:

file.fasta - Fasta file with the sequences to be aligned

outpath - path where output should be written

err - needed for the GUI

label - needed for the GUI

This module needs clustalo instaled:
http://www.clustal.org/omega/


OUTPUT:

If succesful, msa_clustalo.py will have created a file called "infile" in the
output path. This file is necessary for runnig a phylogenetic inference.
The last function of this script runclustal() will return tha full path where
"infile" is located. This path is where the phylogeny inference scripts must be
ran.
