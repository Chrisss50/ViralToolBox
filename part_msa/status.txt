Logging implemented module complete

What this does:

Given a multiple set of sequences, msa_clustalo.py will perform a multiple sequence
alignment using clustal-omega with standard parameters. 

Running this script requieres clustalo instaled, a fasta input file with multiple 
sequences, and a name for the output file.
