msa_phylip.py computes phylogenetic inference  on a set of input
sequences provided in a MSA file in phylip format

This script checks if certain phylip tools are instaled, checks the script was
run properly, and then proceeds to run the phylogenetic inference.

To run this script the next programs myst be instaled:

dnadist
dnaml
dnapars
neighbor
consense

This tools are part of phylip and can be found here:
http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html

Additionally the following python module must be installed:

ete2
http://pythonhosted.org/ete2/


Usage:
python phyl_phyl.py infile  err label

The parameters are:

infile - Fasta file with the sequences to be aligned

err - needed for the GUI

label - needed for the GUI


OUTPUT:

phyl_phly.py will run several programs that rather than taking any parameters,
assume there exists a file name infile. The script will manage file renaming in
order for every program to run correctly. 

The programs will run as follows:

dnadist - infile will be the MSA file. After running, inflie will become msa.phy
          and outfile will be renamed infile

neighbor - computes neighbor joining tree with infile. infile will become distance_matrix.txt
           outtree will become nj.tree, msa.phy will become infile

dnaml - computes tree with maximum likelihood algorithm, outtree becomes ml.tree

dnapars - computes tree with maximum parsimony algorithm, outtree becomes mp.tree

consense - computes consensus tree, first with mp.tree and then with all other trees
